# Arthurita

Arthurita is a collection of Minecraft utilities written in TypeScript with the goal of being fast, well-tested and lightweight. Arthurita is currently in development and is not ready for production use.

Arthurita currently has utilities for Minecraft **[data types](https://github.com/davipatricio/arthurita/tree/main/packages/encoding)**, **[NBTs](https://github.com/davipatricio/arthurita/tree/main/packages/nbt)**, **[packets](https://github.com/davipatricio/arthurita/tree/main/packages/packets)** and a Minecraft compatible **[server](https://github.com/davipatricio/arthurita/tree/main/packages/server)**.

Currently we are focusing on adding support for the 1.8.9 Minecraft version.
